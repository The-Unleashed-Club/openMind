# OpenMind

Innovative Conversations: Powered by OpenAI's Cutting-edge API. 
The App gives instant Responses to Your Messages in Real-time. App also can create original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles which is powered by open-AI. We are using RapidAPI services to fullfill our requirements. We are also working on cross-site conversation between different users, where our app can give you professional suggestions to your messages, emails etc.  


### Our vision

The problem is that users rely on web applications, which provide links to various websites when searching for answers to their questions. This process is time-consuming, and the user may not always find the information they are looking for. The need of the hour is to create a mobile app that will leverage OpenAI tools to provide quick and reliable solutions to user queries, quality, and make urban transportation more efficient and affordable for everyone.
